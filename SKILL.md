# Core principle
**ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.**

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

# The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.


# Workflow: The Five Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

## Phase 0: Context Gathering (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE investigating, ensure you understand the problem space.**

> **STOP and ASK** if any of these are unclear. Use `AskUserQuestion` tool.

### 1. Categorize the Problem Type

| Type | Key Questions to Ask |
|------|---------------------|
| **Bug/Error** | What is the expected vs. actual behavior? Can you reproduce it? |
| **Security** | Threat model? Internal or external attacker? What permissions do they have? |
| **Performance** | What metric? What's acceptable? Where does it degrade? |
| **Integration** | Which systems are involved? What are the boundaries? |

### 2. Clarify Scope and Assumptions

**Always ask yourself:**
- What am I assuming that might be wrong?
- What context is the user not telling me?
- What would change my approach if I knew more?

**For Security Analysis specifically:**
- [ ] Who is the attacker? (Anonymous user, authenticated user, admin, insider?)
- [ ] What permissions/access do they START with?
- [ ] What is the target? (Data, privileges, availability?)
- [ ] Internal network access or external only?
- [ ] What's already been ruled out?

### 3. Ask Clarifying Questions

**Examples of good clarifying questions:**
- "Welche Berechtigungen hat der User bereits?"
- "Geht es um einen externen Angreifer oder einen authentifizierten User?"
- "Was genau soll geschützt werden?"
- "Gibt es bekannte Einschränkungen oder Annahmen?"

**Red Flag:** If you're about to spawn 3 agents but can't clearly state the problem in one sentence → STOP and clarify first.

## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

> **MANDATORY:** Verwende das **Task-Tool** mit `subagent_type="general-purpose"` 
> für diese 3 Agenten. Spawne alle 3 in **einem einzigen Message-Block** (parallel). Each performs the same complete investigation independently:

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - They often contain the exact solution
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - Does it happen every time?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**

   **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**
   ```
   For EACH component boundary:
     - Log what data enters component
     - Log what data exits component
     - Verify environment/config propagation
     - Check state at each layer

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
   THEN investigate that specific component
   ```

   **Example (multi-layer system):**
   ```bash
   # Layer 1: Workflow
   echo "=== Secrets available in workflow: ==="
   echo "IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}"

   # Layer 2: Build script
   echo "=== Env vars in build script: ==="
   env | grep IDENTITY || echo "IDENTITY not in environment"

   # Layer 3: Signing script
   echo "=== Keychain state: ==="
   security list-keychains
   security find-identity -v

   # Layer 4: Actual signing
   codesign --sign "$IDENTITY" --verbose=4 "$APP"
   ```

   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)

5. **Trace Data Flow**

   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**

   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.

   **Quick version:**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

   After all 3 agents complete (~60s):
- Compare findings
- 3/3 agree → High confidence (0.9+)
- 2/3 agree → Medium confidence (0.7)
- Disagreements → Review manually
- Combine unique findings from all agents
- Synthesize final root cause

**CRITICAL: Phase Completion Gates**

**You MUST NOT proceed to the next phase without completing the current phase fully.**

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

> **MANDATORY:** Verwende das **Task-Tool** mit
> `subagent_type="systematic-debugging:pattern-analyzer"`
> für diese 3 Agenten. Spawne alle 3 in **einem einzigen Message-Block** (parallel).
> Each agent performs the same complete investigation independently:

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line
   - Understand the pattern fully before applying

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?
   - What assumptions does it make?

## Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Write it down
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help
   - Research more

## Phase 4: State the root cause

summarize your findings and ask the senior architect skills for possible soulutions
 

# Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.5)

## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultrathink this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.

## Supporting Techniques

These techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory:

- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger
- **`defense-in-depth.md`** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause
- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling
